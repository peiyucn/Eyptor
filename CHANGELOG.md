All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
## \[0.1.8] - 2026-06-10
### Fixed
- **Blank lines drifting to top of file**: fixed a bug in the minimal-change merge algorithm (`applyMinimalChanges`) where blank lines from the saved file were forever preserved at their original positions while blank lines from the serialized editor output were discarded. Over multiple edit cycles this caused blank lines to progressively drift upward, and a sudden shift could occur when list spread normalization changed the blank-line structure dramatically. The fix uses the serialized output as the structural skeleton, with only LCS-matched non-blank lines substituted from the saved version to preserve user formatting.

## \[0.1.7] - 2026-06-08
### Added
- **TOC panel pinning**: new 📌 pin button in the TOC header. When pinned, the panel stays open regardless of window resize or outside click. Pin state is persisted across sessions.
- **Resizable TOC panel width**: drag the right edge of the TOC panel while pinned to adjust width (200px – 500px). Editor content reflows accordingly. Width is persisted.
- **TOC collapse/expand**: click ▶/▼ to collapse sub-headings; collapse-all / expand-all button in the header. State is persisted.
- **Word count in VS Code status bar**: line count, word count (Word-style), and character count displayed in the native VS Code status bar. Updated in real-time from ProseMirror document text.
### Changed
- **TOC panel default width**: 220px → 200px

## \[0.1.6] - 2026-04-27
### Fixed
- **Scroll position restored on tab switch**: switching away from a Markdown file and back no longer resets the scroll position to the top. The editor now persists the scroll offset via the VS Code WebView state API and restores it when the panel becomes visible again (via `visibilitychange`). Also handles WebView recreation on VS Code restart.

## \[0.1.5] - 2026-04-08
### Fixed
- **Auto-reload on external file changes**: the editor now instantly reflects changes made by AI tools (e.g. Claude Code) or any external program without needing to close and reopen the file. Previously, writes from the same VS Code Extension Host were silently ignored due to VS Code's internal deduplication; atomic writes (rename-based) also caused the file watcher to stop tracking the file after the first replacement. Fixed by switching to Node.js `fs.watch` on the parent directory.
- **IME input**: prevent Chinese/Japanese/Korean intermediate composition states from triggering premature auto-saves, which caused duplicate or garbled characters.
### Added
- **Image path autocomplete**: type `./`, `../`, or `@/` in the image URL input to get smart path suggestions; image files show a 32 px thumbnail preview in the dropdown.
- **`@/`** **alias for image paths**: images referenced as `@/images/foo.png` (workspace root) are now correctly displayed in the editor.

## \[0.1.4] - 2026-04-08
### Fixed
- Fixed the "简体中文" link in the Marketplace README pointing to a non-existent URL (corrected `--baseContentUrl` to include `/blob/main`)
- Fixed incorrect release dates in CHANGELOG for versions 0.1.0–0.1.2
---
## \[0.1.3] - 2026-04-07
### Added
- **Path autocomplete**: type `@/`, `./`, or `../` inside inline code to trigger smart path suggestions
- **Hierarchical directory browsing**: path suggestions show the current directory level; selecting a folder drills into the next level
- **File-type icons**: the suggestion dropdown shows color-coded vscode-icons for 9 file types (folder, TypeScript, JavaScript, Markdown, JSON, CSS, HTML, image, and generic file)
- **`#line-number`** **jump in links**: links such as `README.md#27` or `README.md#27-30` jump directly to the specified line in the target file
---
## \[0.1.2] - 2026-04-07
### Added
- **In-editor search** (`Cmd/Ctrl+F`): FindBar with real-time highlighting via CSS Custom Highlight API; navigate with `Enter` / `Shift+Enter`, dismiss with `Esc`
- **Link popup redesign**: single-card UI with view / edit modes; supports `@/` workspace paths and `#anchor` in-page links
- **In-page anchor navigation** (`#heading`): GitHub-compatible slug, smooth scroll
- **Global search navigation**: clicking a VS Code search result scrolls the WYSIWYG editor to the matching position
- **Code block full-screen editor**: textarea + pre overlay with syntax highlighting, fade-in/out animation; writes back to ProseMirror on close
- **Mermaid diagram rendering** (mermaid 11.x): inline preview, code/preview toggle, zoom, pan, full-screen lightbox
---
## \[0.1.1] - 2026-04-01
### Added
